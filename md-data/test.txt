Test map. A minimal shooting range that can be modified as planned features are implemented.

Now contains a shotgun, a minigun and plasma gun. The latter two would probably in time be modified to represent stationary cannons.

Run PrBoom in a working dir (eg. contains musketd.wad or doom.wad from freedoom or something and prboom.wad from prboom)

prboom -file mappack1.wad

NOTICES:

Skybox textures were not working from musketd.wad or doom.wad if using -file mappack1.wad. So for now they are included in this test map, but this needs to be fixed
